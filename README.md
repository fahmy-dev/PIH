## Prerequisites
- A web browser (Chrome, Brave, Firefox, etc.)
- Visual Studio Code
- A basic understanding of Javascript, HTML and CSS

1. Open your Terminal and clone this repository
- `git clone https://github.com/fahmy-dev/PIH`

2. Move into the directory
- `cd PIH`

3. Open it in VSCode
- `code .`

## The Files
You should see 5 files. 

- **index.html** - HTML file containing the stucture of the web app  

- **script.js** - Js file containing the functionality of the web app

- **style.css** - CSS file containing the styling of the web app 

- **LICENSE** - Contains the License

- **README.md** - Contains this readme

## How to Use it
- Considering this is not utilizing a local json-server and an api instead this process is a lot more straightforward

1. Open your terminal (control + shift + `), and type:

     `open index.html`

- The web app will open in your browser automatically

- You will be greeted with the home page with the photos displayed, each with a heart button and a 'Levae a Comment' box.
- You can click on the heart and it will turn red, indicating you have liked it and to add a comment you simply type into the box and press the enter key to add your comment to the photo.
- To search for whatever you want, you type your search parameters into the search box at the top and once you click search, it will refresh the page with your results in the same format as the home page.
